# ProxyCrawl

Dependency free gem for scraping and crawling websites using the ProxyCrawl API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'proxycrawl'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install proxycrawl

## Crawling API Usage

Require the gem in your project

```ruby
require 'proxycrawl'
```

Initialize the API with one of your account tokens, either normal or javascript token. Then make get or post requests accordingly.

You can get a token for free by [creating a ProxyCrawl account](https://proxycrawl.com/signup) and 1000 free testing requests. You can use them for tcp calls or javascript calls or both.

```ruby
api = ProxyCrawl::API.new(token: 'YOUR_TOKEN')
```

### GET requests

Pass the url that you want to scrape plus any options from the ones available in the [API documentation](https://proxycrawl.com/dashboard/docs).

```ruby
api.get(url, options)
```

Example:

```ruby

begin
  response = api.get('https://www.facebook.com/britneyspears')
  puts response.status_code
  puts response.original_status
  puts response.pc_status
  puts response.body
rescue => exception
  puts exception.backtrace
end

```

You can pass any options of what the ProxyCrawl API supports in exact param format.

Example:

```ruby
options = {
  user_agent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; rv:20.0) Gecko/20121202 Firefox/30.0',
  format: 'json'
}

response = api.get('https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/5bx4bx/thanks_obama/', options)

puts response.status_code
puts response.body # read the API json response
```

### POST requests

Pass the url that you want to scrape, the data that you want to send which can be either a json or a string, plus any options from the ones available in the [API documentation](https://proxycrawl.com/dashboard/docs).

```ruby
api.post(url, data, options);
```

Example:

```ruby
api.post('https://producthunt.com/search', { text: 'example search' })
```

You can send the data as application/json instead of x-www-form-urlencoded by setting options `post_content_type` as json.

```ruby
response = api.post('https://httpbin.org/post', { some_json: 'with some value' }, { post_content_type: 'json' })

puts response.status_code
puts response.body

```

### Javascript requests

If you need to scrape any website built with Javascript like React, Angular, Vue, etc. You just need to pass your javascript token and use the same calls. Note that only `.get` is available for javascript and not `.post`.

```ruby
api = ProxyCrawl::API.new(token: 'YOUR_JAVASCRIPT_TOKEN' })
```

```ruby
response = api.get('https://www.nfl.com')
puts response.status_code
puts response.body
```

Same way you can pass javascript additional options.

```ruby
response = api.get('https://www.freelancer.com', options: { page_wait: 5000 })
puts response.status_code
```

## Original status

You can always get the original status and proxycrawl status from the response. Read the [ProxyCrawl documentation](https://proxycrawl.com/dashboard/docs) to learn more about those status.

```ruby
response = api.get('https://sfbay.craigslist.org/')

puts response.original_status
puts response.pc_status
```

## Scraper API usage

Initialize the Scraper API using your normal token and call the `get` method.

```ruby
scraper_api = ProxyCrawl::ScraperAPI.new(token: 'YOUR_TOKEN')
```

Pass the url that you want to scrape plus any options from the ones available in the [Scraper API documentation](https://proxycrawl.com/docs/scraper-api/parameters).

```ruby
api.get(url, options)
```

Example:

```ruby
begin
  response = scraper_api.get('https://www.amazon.com/Halo-SleepSack-Swaddle-Triangle-Neutral/dp/B01LAG1TOS')
  puts response.status_code
  puts response.body
rescue => exception
  puts exception.backtrace
end
```

## Leads API usage

Initialize with your Leads API token and call the `get` method.

```ruby
leads_api = ProxyCrawl::LeadsAPI.new(token: 'YOUR_TOKEN')

begin
  response = leads_api.get('stripe.com')
  puts response.status_code
  puts response.body
rescue => exception
  puts exception.backtrace
end
```
